Datadog Synthetics uses simulated user requests and browser rendering to help you ensure uptime,
identify regional issues, and track your application performance. Datadog Synthetics tests come in
two different flavors, [API tests](https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/api_tests/?tab=httptest)
and [browser tests](https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/browser_tests). You can use Datadogâ€™s API to
manage both test types programmatically.

For more information about Synthetics, see the [Synthetics overview](https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/).
