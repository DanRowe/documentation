Search your logs and send them to your Datadog platform over HTTP.

## Send logs

Send your logs to your Datadog platform over HTTP. Limits per HTTP request are:

- Maximum content size per payload (uncompressed): 5MB
- Maximum size for a single log: 1MB
- Maximum array size if sending multiple logs in an array: 1000 entries

Any log exceeding 1MB is accepted and truncated by Datadog:
- For a single log request, the API truncates the log at 1MB and returns a 2xx.
- For a multi-logs request, the API processes all logs, truncates only logs larger than 1MB, and returns a 2xx.

Datadog recommends sending your logs compressed.
Add the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to the request when sending compressed logs.

The status codes answered by the HTTP API are:
- 202: Accepted: the request has been accepted for processing
- 400: Bad request (likely an issue in the payload formatting)
- 401: Unauthorized (likely a missing API Key)
- 403: Permission issue (likely using an invalid API Key)
- 408: Request Timeout, request should be retried after some time
- 413: Payload too large (batch is above 5MB uncompressed)
- 429: Too Many Requests, request should be retried after some time
- 500: Internal Server Error, the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request, request should be retried after some time
- 503: Service Unavailable, the server is not ready to handle the request probably because it is overloaded, request should be retried after some time

## Aggregate events

The API endpoint to aggregate events into buckets and compute metrics and timeseries.

## Get a list of logs

List endpoint returns logs that match a log search query.
[Results are paginated][1].

Use this endpoint to see your latest logs.

**If you are considering archiving logs for your organization,
consider use of the Datadog archive capabilities instead of the log list API.
See [Datadog Logs Archive documentation][2].**

## Search logs

[Results are paginated][1].

Use this endpoint to build complex logs filtering and search.
